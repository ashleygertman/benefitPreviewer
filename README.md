# Benefit Previewer


## Description

A web application that allows employers to input employees and their
dependents, and get a preview of the costs:
* The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
* Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
* Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
